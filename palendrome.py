sample1 = input("Enter your text to determine if it is a palendrome: ")
sample1.split (" ")
# To be done:
# 1. convert sample by implimenting .lower, remove punctuation, convert to list by .split by " "
# 2. duplicate sample list, invert sample list
# 3. if sample list == sample list2 - palendrome
# 4. if sample list =/= sample list2 - not a palendrome


print("This is not a palendrome")
